This is the readme file. You read it. 

this page holds the instructions to the game below:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. 
There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your score. 
You win the game by matching your total score to the random number given to you at the beginning of the game. You lose the came if your total score goes higher than the random number.
The values of each of the crystals below is hidden from you until you click on it. 
Each time when the game starts, the same will change the values of each of the crystals below. 

I used jQuery to program the logic associated with this game, and bootstrap for the css and html. 

Ive enjoyed making this game. my pseudocode helped when setting up the logic.
