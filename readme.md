The objective of this app is for the user to click on the crystals in order to get match the random number given to them at the start. Each crystal's value is random and different each time the game is played. 

## Overview:

I used jQuery to program the logic associated with this game, and bootstrap for the css and html. 
Ive enjoyed making this game. my pseudocode helped when setting up the logic.

## Instructions:
[]
You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your score. The values of each of the crystals below is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time when the game starts, all number values are randomized, making the game different each time you play.
